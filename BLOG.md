We have just learnt about CRUD — which stands for Create Read Update Delete. As you might have guessed, those are things you do with databases. And to do that people use SQL, which stands for Structured Query Language. SQL consists of commands which are standarized and allow us to access and modify databases, and perform all CRUD functions, like so:
CREATE:
There are several commands for creation in SQL:
• INSERT INTO — inserts new data into a database
• CREATE DATABASE — creates a new database
• CREATE TABLE — creates a new table
• CREATE INDEX — creates an index (search key)
READ:
To check the data, you can use:
• SELECT — extracts data from a database
UPDATE:
Following SQL commands alter a database:
• UPDATE — updates data in a database
• ALTER DATABASE — modifies a database
• ALTER TABLE — modifies a table
DELETE:
To destroy data, you can use:
• DELETE — deletes data from a database
• DROP TABLE — deletes a table
• DROP INDEX — deletes an index
